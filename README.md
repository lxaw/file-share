# File-Share:
A file-sharing service written in Rust.

# Idea:
Create a simple CLI app that allows for sharing of files among multiple machines.

# Problem:
Often times organizations need a file sharing service, but they are paid for. Thus I would like to provide a free, basic file sharing service.
